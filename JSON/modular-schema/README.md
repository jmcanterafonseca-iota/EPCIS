# EPCIS JSON Schemas

The `EPCIS-JSON-Schema-bundled.json` schema is generated automatically by the `bundle.sh` script. It is included to allow online validators to just work with one file. It contains all the Schemas defined by this specification. 

The `validate.sh` script allows to validate JSON and automatically includes all the individual child schemas.
